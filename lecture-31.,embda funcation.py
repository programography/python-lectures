# anonymous function is a function without a name. Anonymous functions are also called lambda functions. 
#  They are often used when you need a simple, small, and short function for a specific task.
 
#  def xyz()

# syntex:
    
# lambda arguments : expression


# x = lambda a, b : a + b

# print(x(100, 200))

# print(x(1, 2))

# def xyz(a, b):
#     c = a - b
#     print(c)

# xyz(10, 20)


xyz = lambda a : a ** 2

print(xyz(3))
