#               Python Functions
# Functions in Python are blocks of reusable
# code that perform specific tasks or calculations. 

# xyz()

# types of funcation:
#     1) bulit funcations:
#         print()
#         input()
#         type()
#         len()
#         count()
        
#     2) user define funcation


# funcation are used for code optimization
# DRY = do not repete yourself
