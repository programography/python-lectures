#         Recursion (Recursive functions )
        
Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself to solve a problem.


# def factorial(n):
#     if n == 0:
#         return 1
#     else:   
#         return n * factorial(n-1)
#         #   4 x factorial(3)
#         #   4 x 3 x factorial(2)
#         #   4 x 3 x 2 x fa


# x = factorial(5)
# print(x)


# 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24

# 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1







# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ......
